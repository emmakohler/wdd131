            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have always loved being outdoors. It brings me peace and when I see little creatures or flowers I don't normally see, it reminds me of all of Gods creations and that he has a grand plan for me! Finding and learning about different creations of His brings me joy and I wanted to make a webpage that gamifies the animal tracking to create "incentive" to be outside, observing nature more. I believe it is a necessary thing for our health, physical, spiritual, and mental, to be outside.
